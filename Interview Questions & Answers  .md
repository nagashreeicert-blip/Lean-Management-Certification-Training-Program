## 🟦 Beginner Level Questions

### **1. What is Lean Management?**
**Answer:**  
Lean Management is a methodology focused on maximizing customer value while minimizing waste. It aims to improve process flow, reduce delays, eliminate unnecessary steps, and create a culture of continuous improvement.

---

### **2. What are the 7 types of waste?**
**Answer:**  
The seven wastes (TIMWOOD) are:  
- **T**ransport  
- **I**nventory  
- **M**otion  
- **W**aiting  
- **O**verproduction  
- **O**verprocessing  
- **D**efects

---

### **3. What is Value and Non-Value-Added Work?**
**Answer:**  
Value-added work directly contributes to what the customer needs.  
Non-value-added work (waste) consumes resources but does not provide customer benefit.

---

### **4. What is 5S?**
**Answer:**  
5S is a workplace organization method:  
1. Sort  
2. Set in Order  
3. Shine

## 🟩 Intermediate Level Questions

### **6. What is Value Stream Mapping (VSM)?**
**Answer:**  
VSM is a tool used to visualize every step in a process—from input to delivery—to identify bottlenecks, delays, redundancies, and waste. It helps teams design improved workflows.

---

### **7. What is the difference between Push and Pull Systems?**
**Answer:**  
- **Push System:** Work is pushed regardless of demand; often leads to overproduction.  
- **Pull System:** Work is produced only when needed; prevents excess inventory and improves flow.

---

### **8. What are the main pillars of Lean?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**  
2. **Respect for People**  

These principles ensure sustainable, people-driven improvement.

---

### **9. What is Standard Work?**
**Answer:**  
Standard Work defines the best-known process for performing a task. It ensures consistency, reduces variability, and provides a baseline for improvement.

---

### **10. What is an A3 Report?**
**Answer:**  
An A3 is a structured problem-solving tool used to define problems, analyze root causes, identify countermeasures, and communicate solutions using a single page (A3 size).

---

---

## 🟥 Advanced Level Questions

### **11. What is the difference between Kaizen and Kaizen Blitz?**
**Answer:**  
- **Kaizen:** Continuous, small improvements over time.  
- **Kaizen Blitz:** A short, intense improvement event (typically 2–5 days) focused on rapidly solving a critical problem.

---

### **12. How do you implement Lean in an organization resistant to change?**
**Answer:**  
- Start with small pilot projects  
- Show quick wins  
- Use data-driven evidence  
- Engage employees early  
- Train teams in basic Lean tools  
- Communicate benefits consistently  

This builds trust and reduces resistance.

---

### **13. What is Heijunka (Production Leveling)?**
**Answer:**  
Heijunka smooths production by distributing work evenly rather than in spikes. It stabilizes operations, reduces stress, and improves scheduling accuracy.

---

### **14. Explain the concept of “Flow” in Lean.**
**Answer:**  
Flow means work moves without interruptions, rework, or delays. Achieving flow reduces lead time and ensures predictable delivery.

---

### **15. What metrics are used in Lean implementation?**
**Answer:**  
Common metrics include:  
- Lead Time  
- Cycle Time  
- First Pass Yield (FPY)  
- Process Efficiency  
- Inventory Levels  
- Downtime  
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

---

### **16. How do you conduct a Root Cause Analysis?**
**Answer:**  
Use tools like:  
- **5 Why Analysis**  
- **Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)**  
- **Pareto Charts**  
- **Process Mapping**  

The goal is to identify the underlying cause—not the symptoms.

---

### **17. How does Lean differ from Six Sigma?**
**Answer:**  
- **Lean:** Eliminates waste and improves flow.  
- **Six Sigma:** Reduces variation using statistical tools.  
Many organizations combine them as **Lean Six Sigma** for maximum impact.

---

### **18. What is a Gemba Walk?**
**Answer:**  
A Gemba Walk is when leaders go to the actual workplace to observe processes, talk with employees, and identify opportunities for improvement.

---

### **19. How do you ensure Lean improvements are sustained long-term?**
**Answer:**  
- Standardize new procedures  
- Train employees continuously  
- Monitor performance metrics  
- Conduct periodic audits  
- Reinforce Lean culture at all levels  

---

### **20. What is the biggest challenge in Lean transformation?**
**Answer:**  
Cultural change. Tools are easy to learn, but gaining consistent commitment from all employees—including leadership—requires strong communication, trust, and long-term discipline.
